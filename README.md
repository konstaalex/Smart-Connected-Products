# Smart-Connected-Products

During this semester at Fontys for the Smart Connected Products course, our mini-
project will be a Smart Greenhouse Climate Controller. We will utilize the greenhouse
from the Green Tech Lab, and with the help of humidity, temperature, and water sensors, we
will analyze weather patterns. By incorporating stepper motors, we will control the
greenhouse windows to automatically open or close depending on the detected weather
conditions.

For example, if the sensors detect rain or high humidity levels, the windows will
automatically close. Additionally, the windows can be controlled via a dashboard, where the
sensor readings and analyses will also be displayed.
If time permits, we plan to add extra sensors to monitor indoor humidity and ground
water detection, which will trigger the doors or windows accordingly.
